# Bourbon-dsc-bot
My simple Discord bot. My first time with JavaScript but it might get interesting overtime
Prefix: ! 
Available commands:
info(arguments: version)
ping(replies with some message, you can check if bot is up)

Planned commands:
clear (bulk deletion of messages)
join (joins a voice channel a user is on)
leave (leaves a voice channel it's on)
play (plays some music from YouTube or add a video to the queue)
for now there will be just some basic features, but I hope I will get adn realize more ideas
